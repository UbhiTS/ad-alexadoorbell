### For Sonos, set announce_bell:false (thanks to @5and0)
### For Google Home, set announce_bell:false (can someone please confirm?)

Alexa and other smart speakers will notify you like a doorbell, (thus the name, so creative isn't it!) based on a motion sensor placed on your doorway. Ever since we've set this up in our home, we always get praises and surprised looks from our guests when they come. Your home suddenly gets a voice, something like Jarvis ... Awesome! 

You can also :- 
- add a door sensor (like the [Ecolink Door Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Window-Contact-sensors-Battery/dp/B07PDDX3K6/ref=sr_1_16?dchild=1&keywords=eco+wave+door+sensor&qid=1587791320&s=electronics&sr=1-16) or any other) to only ring the bell if the door is currently closed, and has been closed for at least the last 30 seconds. This is so that the bell only rings when someone arrives at your door and not when you step out.
- add an outdoor Alexa (or other smart speaker) to greet your guest with a pleasant message based on the time of day
- add a doorbell (like the [Aeotec Doorbell](https://aeotec.com/z-wave-doorbell/) or any other) to ring when a guest arrives outside your door
